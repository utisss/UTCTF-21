 ## Solution
Following the link will take you to NiseCo's website with information about their company. The part that should be most interesting is that they list their team members and give a little bit of information about each one. There is a lot of useful info we can get here, such as the format they use for their e-mails and obviously their employee's names. Perhaps the most interesting information is that Wade Coldwater is avid social media user. Searching with google we'll find a Linkedin profile, but it's a dead end. Our next thought might be to use a tool like sherlock, but it isn't always reliable. If you instead use the search functions of any particular site he might have an account on we'll get better results. If we search for him on twitter we will instantly find him. Once on his page we see a few interesting posts including a photo of his ID badge for his new job at NiseCo. Kid needs OpSec training.
