# Emoji Encryption
 * **Event:** UTCTF
 * **Problem Type:** Miscellaneous
 * **Point Value / Difficulty:** Easy (200 pts)
 * **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:** 
 ## Solution
 Note that the first few emojis are 
**U**mbrella
**T**urkey
**F**ire
**L**ion
**A**pple
**G**uitar
If you take the first letter of each emoji, it maps to the letter it replaces. If you assume this pattern continues for the rest of the flag (which it does), then you can decode the whole flag and keep punctuation as is.
