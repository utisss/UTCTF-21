# Cipher Gauntlet
* **Event:** UTCTF 2021
* **Problem Type:** Beginner
* **Point Value / Difficulty:**
* **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:**

## Steps
#### Step 1
This challenge has you decoding a string of different ciphers to eventually reach the flag. The encodings/ciphers in order are **[Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)** -> **[Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)** -> **[Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)**, and you can either use a tool like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to solve it or use a variety of online decoders (here are some ones I would recommend: [Binary decoder](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-ascii.html), [Base64 decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/), [Caesar cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher)). When you get through all the layers, you should be able to decode the flag: `utflag{now_youre_playing_with_crypto}`.
