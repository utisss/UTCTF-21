# Problem Oink

The oink site allows you to upload arbitrary text. The link to your oink should be unique and hash so it's hard to find valid other oinks. You're able to accesses other peopls oinks by incrementing and decrementing the number after /oink/. The flag is hidden in oink 2 which the users aren't able to overwrite.
