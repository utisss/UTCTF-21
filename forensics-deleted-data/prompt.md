# Deleted Data
We got a copy of an elusive hacker's home partition and gave it to someone back in HQ to analyze for us. We think the hacker deleted the file with the flag, but before our agent could find it, they accidentally deleted the copy of the partition! Now we'll *never* know what that flag was. :(
