 ## Solution
 Going back to the social media account of the first osint problem and looking for the link to a google drive should take you to a picture. From here download the picture, and upload it to a google image search. This should provide you with a few "similiar" photos and once you scroll all the way doen you'll see the photo is from a blog owned by Tobias Maier. In his blog you will find the flag for this challenge.
