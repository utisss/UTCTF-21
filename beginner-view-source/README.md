## Steps
#### Step 1
The prompt mentions that I hid the flag in the source code of the UTCTF website. Luckily, there's a cool feature in most web browsers that allows you to see the source code of a webpage.

#### Step 2
If you right click on the website, you should see an option in the menu called `View Page Source` (or something similarly-named depending on browser). Right at the top of the source code, you should see the flag: `utflag{you_found_me_0123959}`.
